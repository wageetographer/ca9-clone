      <description>The most successful mediations are typically those in which both counsel and their clients are fully prepared. Thorough preparation means understanding both the legal and the practical dimensions of the dispute. Counsel will want to make sure that they understand the relevant law and facts, know the standard of review on appeal, and that they have considered how the appeal, and the litigation itself, serves the client’s larger goals.  Legal analysis alone may be only one part of the equation.</description>

      <description>Questions to Consider When Preparing for Mediation   Mediation works best when all participants know what really matters to them. What are the key needs and interests of yours that, if satisfied, would allow you to resolve this matter? Key needs or interests could be, for example, certainty, closure, economic security, avoidance of legal precedent, avoidance of future litigation, fairness, respect, understanding or institutional change.   What are the key interests of the other parties to the dispute?</description>

      <description>Mediation at the appellate level provides just as many opportunities for resolution as mediating at the district court level. Indeed, many of the reasons to mediate at the trial court level still exist on appeal: time, expense, risk of loss, preservation of a relationship, a desire to make or avoid legal precedent, etc. An agreement crafted through mediation may prove a better remedy than what a court could fashion. The pause in the proceedings provided by the appeal can offer the parties an opportunity to reevaluate these interests.</description>
