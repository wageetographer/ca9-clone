If the parties settle the case, the Circuit Mediator will work with them to ensure that the proper documentation dismissing the appeal is filed with the court. If the parties are unable to resolve their appeal, the matter will be released from the Mediation Program and the mediator will ensure that all procedural matters, such as briefing schedules, etc., have been taken care of.
